## Problem Statement:

### Heart Disease Prediction

Develop a predictive model to determine whether a person has a heart disease or not, based on the user-entered values.

## Task Details:

Our team has successfully tackled the challenge of Heart Disease Prediction. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, our model processes user-provided data to assess the likelihood of a person having a heart disease. With accurate predictions, we aim to contribute to early diagnosis and better healthcare outcomes.

## How to Use Our Model:

1. **Input User Data:**
   - Provide the necessary information as prompted by the application.
   - Include details such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant parameters.

2. **Prediction Process:**
   - Our model processes the entered data using complex algorithms.
   - Based on the analysis, it provides a prediction regarding the presence or absence of heart disease.

3. **Interpret the Results:**
   - The model output will clearly indicate whether the user is likely to have a heart disease or not.
   - Users can use this information for further medical consultation and evaluation.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python:** Core programming language for model development.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Leveraged libraries like scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **User Interface:** Designed a user-friendly interface to capture user data effectively.

## Note:

This project was developed as part of the RGIT Hackathon by Team The-Backbenchers. We believe that early detection plays a crucial role in managing heart diseases, and our predictive model is designed to assist in this critical area of healthcare.
